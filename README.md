# [SynMob](https://yasoz.github.io/SynMob/)

## Introduction

This dataset is a high-fidelity synthetic GPS trajectory dataset designed for urban mobility analysis. The dataset consists of a large collection of synthetic GPS trajectory data that can be used for studying various aspects such as modeling real-world movement patterns, route planning, traffic flow, and more.

## Dataset Features

- **Synthetic Nature**: The trajectory data in this dataset is generated through simulation and is not real GPS data.
- **High Fidelity**: The generated trajectory data aims to preserve spatial and temporal characteristics similar to real-world data.
- **Coverage**: The dataset covers major areas in several cities, including: Chengdu and Xi'an.
- **Diversity**: The dataset includes various types of movement patterns and human behaviors.
-  **Availability**: This synthetic dataset is publicly available, and no concerns about privacy.
- **Scalability**: The trajectory synthesizer can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic trajectories.

## Dataset Usage

### Data Format

The dataset is stored in the common **pickle** format, with two separate files for attribute information and trip trajectory. For attribute information, each example typically includes the following fields:

- **Trip distance**: Records the distance for each trip.
- **Trip time**: The total time of the trip
- **Departure time**: The time of trip start, with 5-min duration for each value.
- **Sample points**: Total number of trajectory sampling points for each trip.

For the trip trajectory, each sample is represented as  a sequence of successively sampled GPS points with recorded **longitude** and **latitude**, respectively

```
pythonCopy code
import pickle

# Load the attributes
attr_path = './attrs.pkl'
with open(attr_path, 'rb') as f:
    attrs = pickle.load(f)
   
# Load the trajectories
trajs_path = './trajs.pkl'
with open(trajs_path, 'rb') as f:
    trajs = pickle.load(f)

# Write your data analysis, model training, etc. code here
# ...
```
